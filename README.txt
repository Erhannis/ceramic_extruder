Paste extruder, based distantly on RichRap's Universal Paste Extruder https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20733 (CC-A).
Fits on his Quick-Fit X Carriage https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19590 (CC-A), which I've adapted into a
platform for the Snappy 3 (see https://github.com/Erhannis/quickfit ).
Uses my OpenSCAD translation of one of GearDownForWhat's gearboxes, and like...just, a bunch of pieces from
all over.
The snap-in joiners - I think from BOSL, at some level?
The gear design - GearDownForWhat
The gear teeth - janssen86
The attachment plate - hexdoll
If you want more details, follow the dependency links in get_deps.sh

See the scad file for details on how to print it, etc.
(Everything with a gear on it should be printed at -0.08 horizontal expansion, -0.3 initial layer horizontal expansion.
That's virtually the only thing that matters....probably.  BUT I usually printed at 0.15 layer height, 0.4 nozzle.  PLA.)
